# Physics and Coding Synergy 

`Physics` and `Coding` are two interconnected fields that often complement each other, particularly in scientific and technological advancements. Coding empowers physicists to tackle complex problems, analyze data, develop simulations, and advance our understanding of the physical world. The combination of physics and coding enables groundbreaking research, technological innovations, and the development of new scientific methodologies.

To fully exploit physics and coding synergy, we're going to have a monthly meeting schedule:

1. Approximately once a month, the specific meeting time will be confirmed three days in advance.
2. The focus of the meetings will be on programming as a tool to solve specific research-related problems: Programming is likened to a shovel, while research is the gold mine.
3. In the first six months, the meetings will primarily cover the fundamentals of physics as the gold mine, teaching participants to use tools like `python` as shovels. After six months, we will progress to using advanced shovels: `python` + `artificial intelligence (AI)`.
